## Video transcript

Man: It's your job! I give you money, you give me ideas!

Girl: You never say thank you!

Man: That's what the money is for! You're young! You will get your recognition! And honestly, it is absolutely ridiculous to be two years into your career and counting your ideas! Everything to you is an opportunity. And you should be thanking me every morning when you wake up, along with Jesus for giving you another day.

## My Reply

Every time I see someone posting this video I have to say this: Jesus gives me ideas and I give them to you, you should be thanking Jesus that I work for you!

Doesn't matter whether I myself am religious or not. This employer brought up Jesus first, and I'm just replying to him in her position.

## What is he doing?

He said that he gives her money and she gives him ideas. This is the only correct sentence in this video. The rest of it is pure gaslighting.

Even if it’s true that she’s paid to do the work, it does not justify this humiliation. He looked down on her and compared himself to Jesus. That's not a decent way to treat others or to see himself.

He said that she’s young and she will get recognition in the future, and it’s ridiculous to count ideas after two years of work.

These are two controversial statements. If she’s young and two years is nothing, then she has every right to fight for her recognition. If two years makes her a senior staff, then she should always be recognized for her work.

Either way, he should have given her what she wanted but he failed to do so.

And this “Everything to you is an opportunity” is even laughable. We see “Opportunity” a lot in scam emails, just delete them and don’t waste your time reading, you have better things to do.

## Comments and Thoughts

Some people might say that work is work, it’s fair enough to know you’re good at your job and actually there are people who can replace you out there.(They fear losing the job if they fight for recognition)

It’s important to be confident and to acknowledge your competitors. But if your work is not appreciated, how do you know that you are good at what you do?

And if you worry about losing your job every day, how can you focus on it and improve skills?

Positive feedbacks can motivate you to make more efforts, while proper criticism might guide you through brighter ways.

But humiliation leads to nowhere, however you put it.
